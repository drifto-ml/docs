<Warning>This is an experimental op and is subject to change.</Warning>

`SUMMARIZE(<X>, **kwargs)`: This operation summarizes the text in each row of the column. 
This is an element-wise column operation, so each row will be summarized independently.
If `<X>` is a string literal, it is broadcast out to the expected number of columns for
the query.

  The input column containing the text to summarize.
</ParamField>

 <ParamField query="style" type="VARCHAR" default='extractive'>

    - The `'extractive'` option returns summaries comprised of the most relevant 
  and important text that is already present in the given text.
    - The `'abstractive'` option returns summaries comprised of new, generated text
   that clearly and succintely captures the meaning and essence of the given text. 
</ParamField>
  
<ParamField query="style" type="VARCHAR" default='passage'>
  The style and length of summary produced. Options = `{'passage', 'sentence', 'bullets'}`.
