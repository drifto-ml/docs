`SIM (<X>,<Y>)`: This operation computes a symmetric semantic similarity score between `<X>` and `<Y>`. This score captures how similar two  This is an element-wise column-valued operation.

Both arguments may be columns or strings. If an argument is a string, it broadcasts the string out to the column argument. If both arguments are strings,
they are both broadcast out to the expected number of rows based on the
table.

The semantic similarity score 

It is always between -1 and 1. A score of
greater than 0.3 indicates that two texts are similar and a score greater than
0.4 indicates that two texts are highly similar.

### Args

<ParamField query="X" type="VARCHAR">
  The first arugment for the semantic similarity score. `X` must be a column of type `VARCHAR` or a `VARCHAR` literal.
