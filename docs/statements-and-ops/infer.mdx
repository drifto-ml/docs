`INFER(X,Y)`: This is an element-wise column operation. X should be a string
literal and Y should be a column of texts. Infer computes the logical validity
or correctness of statement X over each row in Y. A score greater than 0.8
indicates a mild match, a score greater than 0.9 indicates a moderate match, and
a score greater than 0.95 indicates a strong match.

### Example

```sql
SELECT INFER('This person finds our product too expensive', review_text) FROM product_reviews_table;
```
