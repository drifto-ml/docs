title: "SENTIMENT"
---

`SENTIMENT(<X>)`: This operation computes a semantic sentiment score for given text.
This is an element-wise column operation. The text in each row recieves an independent sentiment score.
The sentiment score is real-valued and between -1 and 1. A score greater than zero indicates positive sentiment 
and a score less than zero indicates a negative sentiment. The strength of the sentiment is reflected in
the magnitude (absolute value) of the score. Thus, scores near zero are neutral or close to neutral sentiment.
