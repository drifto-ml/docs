`MEDOIDS(X,Y)`: This is a table-valued function. Use this operation to compute a
summary statistic for each cluster. This returns the medoids from a cluster
result. X is a column of raw data, Y is a column returned by `CLUSTER(X)`.

### Example

```sql
SELECT \* FROM MEDOIDS(X, CLUSTER(X)) Present in: FROM
```

`MEDOIDS(X)`: This is a table-valued function. Equivalent to
`MEDOIDS(X, CLUSTER(X))`.

Present in: `FROM`
