`SIM (X,Y)`: This is an element-wise column operation. Computes symmetric
semantic similarity between X and Y. Both arguments may be columns or literals.
If an argument is a string literal, it broadcasts out to the column argument.
The semantic similarity is a fuzzy match score that captures how similar the
meanings between two texts are. It is always between -1 and 1. A score of
greater than 0.3 indicates that two texts are similar and a score greater than
0.4 indicates that two texts are highly similar.

**Example**:

```
SELECT SIM(‘cat’, pets) FROM pets_table;
```
