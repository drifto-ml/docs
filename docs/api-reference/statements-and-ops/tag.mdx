title: "Tag"
---

`TAG(‘a,b,c‘, X, **kwargs)`: This is a table-valued function (TVF). The first
argument is a literal string that should be a comma-separated list of tags. X
should be a table column. This operation runs a zero-shot NLP tagging operation
that determines if each label in the first argument applies to each row in
column X. The generated table includes confidence scores for each tag.

**Args**:

- multiclass (boolean) – Set to false if the tag labels mutually exclusive.
  Default = true

**Example**:

```
SELECT * FROM TAG(‘payments, rewards, delivery, menu, food quality’, app_reviews_table.app_review);
```
