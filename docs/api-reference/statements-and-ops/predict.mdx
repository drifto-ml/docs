`PREDICT (T)`: This is a table-valued function (TVF). T should be a table and
this function returns a table. It should be used in a `FROM` clause. This
operation returns predictions and confidence scores for each row in T based on
running model mymodel. The name mymodel can also be a string literal and it
should be an exact match to the model name in the MLflow registry.

**Example**:

```sql
SELECT \* FROM PREDICT(mymodel, datatable);
```
