title: "Create Model"
---

`CREATE MODEL`: This statement allows you to invoke Drifto’s autoML
capabilities. `CREATE MODEL` creates a new model that is stored in your model
registry with the given name. By default, Drifto uses an internal MLflow
instance, but can be configured to use an external instance as well.

The `SELECT` subquery should return the full training dataset (held-out sets are
automatically subsampled). Each row in the dataset corresponds to one data point
for ML training and each column is a feature. The `WITH` clause is optional but
without it, the training procedure will use a default configuration and expect
the target column to be called `target`.

**Syntax**:

```
CREATE MODEL<model> WITH (\*\*kwargs) AS <select>;
```

**Args**:

- `target` (column or literal) – The name of the target column. Default =
  `target`
- `algo` (column or literal) – The training algorithm. Options = {`auto`, `gbm`,
  `xgboost`, `glm`,`mlp`}. Default = `auto`
- `ensemble` (bool) – Allow algorithms to generate ensembles. Default = false
- `max_models` (int) – Number of models to search for in a training algorithm.
  Default = 3
- `seed` (int) – Random seed to use. Default = 1.

**Example**:

```
CREATE MODEL mymodel WITH (target=y, max_models=10) AS SELECT \* FROM mydata;
```
