Drifto is a fully-managed query engine and AI service. We also offer the option
to self-host within your cloud environment. Drifto implements Prestoâ€™s
integration protocol, so it integrates seamlessly anywhere SQL runs, such as
your favorite BI tool like Looker or Mode, or a dbt pipeline. We also include a
SQL CLI.

Currently, Drifto works with the following backend query engines / warehouses:

- BigQuery
- Snowflake
