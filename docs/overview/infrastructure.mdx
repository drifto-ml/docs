Drifto combines CPUs and GPUs to deliver best-in-class AI inference at a cost
effective price point. Driftoâ€™s plug-and-play AI inference and training
operations are highly optimized with low precision, distilled models as well as
co-designed with the hardware architecture to deliver high utilization. Drifto
uses configurable auto-scaling to make sure that compute capacity is saturated
but not over-provisioned. This enables a serverless experience for both AI
training and inference all from within SQL queries.
