Drifto operates as a query engine. This means that your data and model storage
is not managed by Drifto. Rather, your data is stored either in your warehouse,
data lake or simple storage buckets, and your models are stored in a model
registry like MLflow. This enables Drifto to be a lightweight compute system on
top of your existing data stack rather than a new system that needs a heavy
integration and migration.

When you issue a query to Drifto, the parser will split the query into
analytical and neural subqueries. Drifto then forwards the analytical subquery
to your underlying analytical query engine, such as your data warehouse, while
processing the neural subquery on a specialized distributed AI fleet. When the
subqueries complete, Drifto merges the two subquery results into one single
result.
