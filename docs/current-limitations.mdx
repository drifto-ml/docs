<Note>To be fixed soon!</Note>

- Drifto ops in `JOIN` clauses are not supported yet.
- Drifto table-valued functions (TVFs) do not allow subqueries inside of the TVF call. For example,
  `SELECT * FROM PREDICT(SELECT * FROM table);` is not yet supported
- Drifto ops are not yet supported in table-free queries (for example, `SELECT SIM('cat','dog')`).
