<Note>To be fixed soon!</Note>

- Drifto ops are not usable in `JOIN` clauses yet.
- Drifto TVFs do not allow subqueries inside of the TVF call. For example,
  `SELECT * FROM PREDICT(SELECT * FROM table);` does not work yet.
- Table-free queries that use Drifto ops are not yet supported (for example, `SELECT SIM('cat','dog')`).
